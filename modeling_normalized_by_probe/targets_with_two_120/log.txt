1. bedtools intersect -a IDT.bed -b target_with_two_120 -wa > two_probe_of_each_target_120
this is to get the probe which cover targets_with_two_120mer

2. bedtools coverage -a Target_with_two_120.txt -b two_probe_of_each_target_120.txt -d > 
two_probe_of_each_target_120_each_base.txt
this is to get each pos of the probe

3. model_multiple_probe.py 
	a. normalize (need to consider linking the probes for one target together) 
	b. match_line
	c. GC
